# NYC-Restaurant-Food-Ordering-and-Delivery
 Analysis of delivery time, food preparation time on weekend and weekday, the most expensive cuisine types and the most common cuisine types. 
 
 What factos affect the rating of the food orders?
 
How do the restaurants improve the quality of the food orders (represented by the rating)?

However, the rating is not representative as a lot of orders are not rated. The final results may not be accurate and only for reference.

I use K-means clustering to group the orders into 5 groups and examine the characteristics of each group to determine which factors may result in better rating. 

Overall, the types of cuisine do not affect how the customers feel about the orders.
